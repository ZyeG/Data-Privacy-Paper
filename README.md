# Data-Privacy-Paper

This paper is an individual work for ECE1724/LAW545 Data Privacy.

This paper explores the question: “What can individuals do, and what is needed at a broader level, to protect data privacy?” Starting from a personal and bottom-up perspective, the paper draws on course materials to explore practical knowledge and strategies that individuals can adopt. It then shifts focus to systemic, top-down solutions, specifically emphasizing compliance and privacy by design; key topics include standardized privacy policies for compliance, and technical discussions on Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), and its countermeasure Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Through this retrospective and reorganized synthesis, the paper underscores the need for an integrated approach to data privacy that combines individual action with robust system-level safeguards.
